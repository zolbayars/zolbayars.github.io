My [ePortfolio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zolbayarq/) in Linkedin

_An efficient ePortfolio might be the best online investment you can make without spending a dime. Just tend your LinkedIn occasionally as if it were your garden. _

_Here are some tips you can apply from the Georgia Tech's "Build your professional ePortfolio in English" course._

## Headline

#### 1\. Job Title

It's different from the _Fields of Study _such as Engineer**ing**, Mathemat**ics**, and Computer Science. Most job titles end with _\-ian, -ant, -er, ist _like Consult**ant**, Engine**er**, Biolog**ist**. The job title should be the first word in your headline.

#### 2\. Action Verb

Pick a right action verb for your current position. It's actually what you do for a living so it might not be hard.

#### 3\. Object of Action Verb

If you're a teacher and the teaching is what you do, what do you actually teach is equally important in the headline.

#### 4\. Purpose of your action

Why do you do your job? What's the purpose of your action?

## Summary

#### 1\. Introduction

1.  Job title + years of experience. (I'm a software developer with 5 years of experience.)
2.  Current goal. (I am looking for new opportunities in the field.)
3.  Combine these 2 into one sentence by using the magical "**, and**". (I'm a software developer with 5 years of experience, and I am looking for new opportunities in the field)
4.  Describe yourself with the 2 essential qualities you have. Select 2 adjectives that will best describe you. **I am a hardworking and gritty professional. **

#### 2\. What you did and completed

> _I built web services._

Add information about the client, the place and the time.

> _I build web services for the banks our company partnered with in 2018. _

Use transitional words like _also, in addition, finally _to put all these together.

> For job: _I am seeking employment or new opportunities in the field_.
> 
> For showing our work and connecting: _I am hoping you will look at my site and letting me know what you think_.
> 
> For selling: _I am hoping you’ll look at my products and think about purchasing one_.
> 
> Part 1 & 2 combined: _I am an accountant with 5 years of experience, and I am seeking new opportunities in the field._

#### 3\. Additional Skills

> My skills include computer programming and web design.
> 
> I am skilled in computer programming and web design.

## Media Captions

Your ePortfolio should showcase your accomplishments with some media. Captioning them correctly would be an essential part of that.

> Here's a website that I created for the "XYZ Holdings" in Hong-Kong in 2019.

1.  Start with _here is_ or _this is (here are or there are)_
2.  Name what you're displaying
3.  Add client, place, and date.

Make it longer:

*   Essential characteristics of your work. (by feeling and seeing your product) Avoid general words like _good_ or _nice_.
*   How your product helper your client (Who you worked for and how it helped)
*   Positive feelings about your work. _I am interested in this picture _rather than _This picture is interesting._

> _These chairs are durable and custom-designed. It helped the Johnson family seat up to 30 guests for their 20th anniversary. I am delighted about these chairs and the results._

Use verbs that indicate CHANGE! Here are some big words for big changes you've made in your company: _overhauled, reorganized, restructured, revamped, redesigned._

If you still have that job, use _\-ing_ form of the verb.

> *   Increased...

## Connect with other professionals in your field

Leave positive comments on someone's work

*   Avoid commenting on a specific part of the work. Use general compliments (though use it when you really want to complement)
*   Show interest. Ask WH questions.
*   Make requests with thanks in front ~ _Would you mind looking at my work? _

Use social networks to advance your career.

1.  Introduction + Goal ~ _I'm a Bla bla with X years of experience in Y and I'm looking for a new Bla opportunity. _
2.  Use hashtags in your job title.
