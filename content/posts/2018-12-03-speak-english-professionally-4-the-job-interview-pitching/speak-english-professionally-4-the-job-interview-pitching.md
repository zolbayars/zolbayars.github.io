## Job Interview

_I didn't do many job interviews when I got my current job. Nonetheless, it was stressful to talk about yourself intensely with complete strangers. But I think it would have been so much easier if I just did my part and practiced a bit._

### Preparation

First impression: Body language. Be aware of your body language. Film yourself and review your body language. Mirror and copy the interviewer's body language. It brings you closer. Body language shapes who you are and how you feel about yourself.

> Treat others as you would like to be treated.
