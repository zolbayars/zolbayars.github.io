## Telephone Language

Phone calls have potentials to lead you to success (much like everything else). More and more people seem to use their phone as a pocket computer. But it's still important to learn how to have a decent conversation on the phone. Introduce yourself, state your purpose, make no misunderstandings and close with a friendly manner. **Phone conversation with someone new (someone you don't know):**

1.  Tell your name
2.  Your position or work title - _Leave it if the person you're talking to knows you_
3.  Purpose of call

> _Hello, this is Zolbayar Bayrsaikhan. I work at SKYtel LLC, and I'm calling about my order of 16 unicorns. Could you please confirm the delivery date?_

**Ways to respond with "YES":**

*   Yes, I'd be happy to
*   Certainly, what would you like to know?
*   Of course. ~ _Do you have a minute to..._
*   Not at all. ~ _Would you mind..._

**Polite ways to respond with "NO":**

*   I'm sorry, I'm unable to confirm at this time. I'll get back with you as soon as I can.
*   Unfortunately, I'm not able to at this time. Could I call you back?
*   Sorry, I'm busy right now but will be happy to call you back.

**Ways to ask for clarification** (_Tons of problems could happen during a nice telephone conversation. Don't panic at times like that. Just ask for a repetition or a clarification_):

*   I'm sorry. I missed that. What did you just say?
    *   Oh, let me explain.
*   Excuse me. I didn't catch what you said. Could you say it again, please?
    *   I'd be happy to.
*   Sorry. I'm not sure I understand. What does that mean?
    *   Certainly, what I mean is...

**Ways to close the conversation** (You should close the conversation politely with an offer to get in touch again):

*   Thanks so much. I look forward to speaking with you again. Goodbye.
*   It's been great talking to you. Thank you. Goodbye.
*   I've enjoyed this conversation and hope we'll talk soon. Goodbye.

## Understand and Be Understood on the Phone

Common errors:

*   Can VS Can't - How the _**a**_ is pronounced is the key
    *   Can - a is short
    *   Can't - a is long and stressed
*   Teens VS Tens ~ four<span style="color:#ff6600;">teen</span> and <span style="color:#ff6600;">fort</span>y
*   $59.99 - fifty-nine ninety-nine

Some takeaways:

*   Always repeat your number by its digits.
*   The tone of voice is the equivalent of the body language on the phone.
*   Phone roleplay is the best way to learn these subtleties.
